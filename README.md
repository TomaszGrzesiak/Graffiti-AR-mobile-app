# Graffiti-AR-mobile-app

With the app, you'll be able to make a graffiti on any flat surface using your smartphone.
The graffiti will do no harm to the surface though. Everything will stay in your phone - using Augmanted Reality.

The basic idea on how it would work:

1. Have an empty, flat surface in front of you.
2. Open the app and see how the app recognizes a surface.
3. Choose what virtual tools you want to use and to start painting.
4. Have fun!

Tech stack:
- Unity
- AR Core
